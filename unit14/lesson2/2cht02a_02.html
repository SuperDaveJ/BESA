<p class='popTitle'>Respirator Use Conditions</p>
<p>The period of time a respirator must be worn is an  important factor when selecting a respirator. You must consider the type of respirator  application, such as whether it will be used for routine, non-routine,  emergency, or rescue use.&nbsp; Keep in mind  that, while respiratory protection is designed to be beneficial for workers, it  can create safety and health concerns if it adds to heat stress, results in  decreased vision, or hinders communication.</p>
<p>How the RP will be used may be affected by the warning  properties of the contaminant.&nbsp; Warning  properties are characteristics that can be perceived by workers, such as odor, which  serve as a warning of the chemical&rsquo;s presence.&nbsp;  When using air purifying respirators (APRs) to control exposure to chemicals  with poor warning properties, specific change out procedures must be  implemented to ensure breakthrough does not occur.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that workers  should not rely solely on their senses to warn them of the presence of  hazardous substances; however, warning properties can be an indicator for  personnel that the RP they are wearing is not effectively controlling the  exposure.</p>
