<p class='popTitle'>Voluntary Use of Respiratory Protection</p>
<p>Respiratory  protection can sometimes be used to increase personal comfort.&nbsp; However, voluntary use of respirators by  government employees in Air Force industrial workplaces is not allowed, except  when BE authorizes the use of filtering facepieces, IAW AFOSH Std 48-137 and <br />
  29  CFR 1910.</p>
<p>Prior  to wearing a voluntary use respirator, employees must request an evaluation of  their individual work conditions by BE if they are not already on the  respiratory protection program. Filtering facepieces are the only type of respiratory  protection that may be worn at the discretion of a government employee for  comfort purposes in an Air Force industrial workplace and must be approved and  authorized by BE.</p>
<p>Voluntary  RP cannot be worn for any industrial task that requires a respirator for  protection against hazards specified by BE, other than exposures to airborne  infectious diseases.&nbsp; Personnel who wear  voluntary use filtering facepieces must receive initial and annual training  from their supervisors on the appropriate use of the device,  including its limitations, per 29 CFR 1910.134 (c)(2) and Appendix D.</p>
