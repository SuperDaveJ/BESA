<p class='popTitle'>Initial Survey</p>
<p>Ideally, an initial test is done before any  ventilation system is put into operation to determine whether the system meets  design specifications.&nbsp; By performing the  test before the process it has been designed to control has started, you avoid  putting workers at risk of being exposed to contaminants if the ventilation  system does not work properly.</p>
<p>Systems installed on the basis of air sampling  results would require an initial survey.&nbsp;  Systems that have been in place for some time may also need an initial  test if they were not correctly evaluated or if they have not been in use.</p>
<p>To determine whether initial survey results are within  standards, you will reference your design criteria which are typically from the  most current <em>Industrial Ventilation</em> manual.</p>
