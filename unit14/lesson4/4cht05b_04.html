<p class='popTitle'>Routine Survey</p>
<p>Local exhaust ventilation systems that are  controlling a contaminant are checked on a routine basis to ensure that the  systems continue to operate adequately.&nbsp;  This reduces the need for routine air sampling and identifies any  maintenance needs.</p>
<p>During the routine  check, you replicate the ventilation measurements taken during the baseline  survey.&nbsp; Therefore, if you checked static  pressure (SP) during the baseline survey, you will take another SP  measurement.&nbsp; If you took face velocity  measurements during the baseline survey because of a nonexistent or  inaccessible duct, you will take the same kind of measurements during the  routine check.</p>
<p>As a guideline, results  should be within 10% of the baseline value and should not be compared to  initial survey results.&nbsp; If results are  not within 10% of the baseline, you should perform troubleshooting procedures  before conducting another baseline test.<br />
  </p>
<p>You  will conduct air sampling in addition to taking ventilation measurements to  determine whether the system continues to effectively capture the  contaminant(s) of concern.</p>
<p>If there is no contaminant to control, routine surveying  is not required unless new processes or contaminant possibilities are  introduced to the environment.&nbsp; </p>
