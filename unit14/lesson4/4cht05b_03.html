<p class='popTitle'>Baseline Survey</p>
<p>The baseline test is done after a local exhaust ventilation  system has been put into operation, to evaluate the system&rsquo;s performance while  conducting the process for which it was installed.&nbsp; Essentially, you are evaluating how well it  controls the contaminant.&nbsp; Air sampling  is an integral part of the baseline test and will be used to ensure that  contaminant levels are maintained at desired levels, typically below the OEL.&nbsp; As you collect personal breathing zone air  samples, you will also take a measurement that indicates the airflow in the  system at that time, typically a static pressure (SP) check.&nbsp; The SP check, which reflects the airflow  volume, should always be taken at the same location in a given branch so the  measurement can serve as a baseline for later comparisons during routine  tests.&nbsp; For a system without a duct, or  one with a duct that is not easily accessible, you will instead take face  velocity measurements.</p>
<p>At times, the initial and baseline surveys may have to  be performed at the same time if BE was not notified prior to the new system  being installed.</p>
