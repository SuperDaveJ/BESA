<p class='popTitle'>Observations</p>
<p>An observation describes a  situation in which criteria established to assess water security or  survivability are deficient for the particular program or asset/access point  being assessed.&nbsp; Observations are generally identified through the use of  checklists that include detailed water-specific criteria.&nbsp; A criterion  that is not met is considered a &ldquo;deficiency,&rdquo; and one or more deficiencies  result in an observation.</p>
<p>Observations are designated as one  of three categories:&nbsp; Vulnerability,  Concern, or Neutral.&nbsp; A vulnerability is  a situation or circumstance that, if left unchanged, may result in the loss of  life or damage to mission-essential resources.&nbsp;  A concern is an existing condition that is exploitable and can  indirectly lead to the death of DoD personnel and/or damage to resources.&nbsp; A neutral observation covers an existing  condition that is neither exploitable nor can be reasonably assessed as leading  to the death of DoD personnel and/or damage to resources, but is being  identified to suggest considerations of modification and/or continuance.</p>
<p>Vulnerabilities are always classified and  concerns are classified when they are associated with a specific US military  site in the same portion of a report or presentation.&nbsp; If a concern is not designated as classified,  it is designated as For Official Use Only (FOUO).</p>
