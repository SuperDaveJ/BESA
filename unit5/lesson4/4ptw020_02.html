  <p class='popTitle'>Chlorination</p>
  <p >The use of chlorine is  desirable because no other widely available disinfectant has its combination of  effectiveness, residual disinfection ability, and adaptability for potable  water treatment. &nbsp;Chlorine is available  at a reasonable cost in forms easy to apply in accurate doses.&nbsp; An easily detectable residual can be  maintained in water, which provides extended and dependable protection.</p>
  <p >Chlorine&rsquo;s disinfecting  ability is due to chemical reactions with enzymes of the organisms  involved.&nbsp; The efficiency of these  reactions is affected by water temperature, pH, contact time, and type and  concentrations of impurities, organisms, and chlorine compounds. </p>
  <p >A major disadvantage of chlorine is that it  reacts with certain organic compounds to form harmful trihalomethanes (such as  chloroform) that are strictly limited by drinking water standards. </p>
