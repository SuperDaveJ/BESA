  <p >Next, CE will flush the  lines again with clean water until the residual chlorine level  returns to normal.</p>
  <p >You will collect  bacteriological samples as well as pH and chlorine samples downstream of the  repair, or, if you don&rsquo;t know the direction of flow, take samples on each side  of the repair.&nbsp; The goals of the sampling  are to ensure chlorine levels are back to normal (based on typical levels in  the system) and to document the effectiveness of the disinfection before the  water is put into use again. &nbsp;The samples  must indicate that the chlorine level is acceptable and no coliform bacteria  are present.</p>
  <p >In some situations, where fire protection or  sanitation concerns dictate, service may be restored immediately provided that  a precautionary boil water notice is issued until you have confirmed drinking  water safety based on bacteriological analysis results.</p>
