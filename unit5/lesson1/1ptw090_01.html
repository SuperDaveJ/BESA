<p>At a minimum, the report should  include the following information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The date the survey was conducted and by whom.</li>
  <li>A schematic drawing of the system and, where  appropriate, photographs of key system components.</li>
  <li>The findings of the survey.</li>
  <li>The recommended improvements to identified  problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clarify any differences  between the findings discussed at the conclusion of the on-site survey and what  is included in the final report with the water system operator and management  prior to the information becoming a part of the official documentation.</p>
<p>The written final report  must have a substantial and descriptive explanation when a system is determined  to have a significant problem that could affect human health. &nbsp;When conducting the survey  inside the U.S.,  the report should be submitted in accordance with state requirements. Additionally, at a minimum, the report should be  marked &ldquo;FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO)&rdquo;.</p>
