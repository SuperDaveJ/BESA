<p class='popTitle'>Subsequent Sanitary Survey Planning</p>
<p>When planning for base  sanitary surveys that are not conducted as part of an initial assessment, you  should review previous survey information, paying particular attention to past  sanitary survey reports and correspondence.&nbsp;  Take note of any previously identified problems and their solutions and,  once in the field, you should verify any action or inaction regarding these  problems. </p>
<p>In addition to past reports  and correspondence, you should review:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Water system plans.</li>
  <li>Water sampling results.</li>
  <li>Operating and maintenance reports.</li>
  <li>Engineering studies. </li>
</ul>
<p>The pre-survey review also  helps you plan the format of the survey and estimate how much time it may take.</p>
