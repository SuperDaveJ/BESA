<p class='popTitle'>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)</p>
<p>The purpose of PPE is to prevent the biological  agent from reaching the workers&rsquo; skin, mucous membranes, personal clothing, or  airways. &nbsp;It must create an effective  barrier between the exposed worker and the agent, thereby breaking the pathway  between source and receiver. &nbsp;PPE  includes respiratory protection, gloves, lab coats, gowns, shoe covers, safety goggles,  and face shields.</p>
<p>In medical treatment facilities, infection control  personnel or the individual workplace is usually responsible for selecting the  PPE.&nbsp; Note that surgical masks are meant  to protect the patient and not the wearer, so they are not to be worn for  respiratory protection.</p>
