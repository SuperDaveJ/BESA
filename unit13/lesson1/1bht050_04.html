<p class='popTitle'>Viruses</p>
<p>Viruses are smaller than bacteria and multiply within living cells.&nbsp; It is important to remember that the  illnesses caused by viruses cannot be treated with antibiotics.</p>
<p>Arthropod-borne  viruses, commonly known as arboviruses, are maintained in nature through  biological transmission between susceptible vertebrate hosts by blood-feeding  arthropods such as mosquitoes and ticks.&nbsp;  Arboviruses are particularly virulent.&nbsp;  In other words, they generally produce disease with severe symptoms.</p>
