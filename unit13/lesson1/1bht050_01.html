<p>The oldest and most abundant life  forms on earth, bacteria are single-cell organisms that usually need moisture  to survive.&nbsp; Although relatively few  bacteria cause infectious disease in humans, the diseases they may cause can be  very serious.&nbsp; Disease-producing bacteria  are often found in fecal matter, and the diseases are transmitted by  humans.&nbsp; Bacterial infections can often  be successfully treated with antibiotics.</p>
<p><em>Rickettsia</em> is a genus of non-motile, non-spore forming, and non-encapsulated bacteria which  are carried as parasites by ticks, fleas, lice, and mites.&nbsp; </p>
