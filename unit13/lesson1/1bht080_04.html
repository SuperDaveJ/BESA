<p class='popTitle'>Infectivity</p>
<p>Infectivity refers to how easily the pathogen infects a host. For example, the chicken  pox and measles viruses are very &ldquo;infective,&rdquo; easily infecting a susceptible  host. On the other hand, the bacteria causing tuberculosis is not very  infective. </p>
<p>Some diseases, such as botulism, are non-contagious, meaning they are  transmitted only from the source to a susceptible person. &nbsp;Other diseases, such as smallpox or influenza,  are contagious and may spread rapidly from one person to another through  populations and across geographic regions. &nbsp;A rapid spread of a contagious disease could have  a significant impact on an installation&rsquo;s mission.</p>
