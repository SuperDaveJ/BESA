<p class='popTitle'>Making Observations</p>
<p>You  can often identify biological health threats by making observations about how  processes are conducted at a particular site.&nbsp;  Even when good standard operating procedures are in place, the  opportunity for human error remains &ndash; potentially opening a pathway for  biological health threat exposures.&nbsp; For  example, improper food handling or poor hand-washing practices in a restaurant kitchen  could cause many people to become ill.&nbsp; In  this particular case, these observations should be reported to Public Health  for further investigation.</p>
<p>When  making observations at a work site for occupational exposures, be sure to also  look for any workers who are exhibiting signs or symptoms of a biological  health threat exposure and may not realize it.</p>
<p>Many biological health threats can be identified through observations of  the environment. &nbsp;For example, water  spots on the ceiling indicate that favorable conditions for mold growth may be  present. </p>
