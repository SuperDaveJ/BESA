<p class='popTitle'>Inhalation</p>
<p>This type of transmission occurs when infectious particles  are released into the air where they can be inhaled into the respiratory system  of a host.&nbsp; Some ways that infectious  particles can be released are when a person coughs or sneezes and when  contaminated surfaces are disturbed.</p>
<p>Droplet transmission and airborne transmission are  two sub-types of inhalation.&nbsp; Droplet  transmission is carried out via relatively large respiratory droplets and  travels short, local distances.&nbsp; Airborne  transmission is carried out via smaller respiratory droplets (called droplet  nuclei) or virus/bacteria attached to dust particles.&nbsp; Airborne transmission is capable of traveling  longer distances than droplet transmission.</p>
