<p class='popTitle'>Conducting Interviews</p>
<p>You  will conduct interviews, in conjunction with Public Health and other medical  personnel, to collect valuable data that may be difficult to collect through  other methods.&nbsp; This data will help you  to properly identify the biological health threats that are or may be present.&nbsp; Public Health will likely interview community  members or other people who have become ill.&nbsp;  These interviews can provide important clues as to common behaviors and  activities which may have spread a disease, as well as locations where the  illness could have been contracted.&nbsp; For  occupational exposures, you can learn information about workers&rsquo; experiences,  any minor accidents that have occurred that haven&rsquo;t been reported, or any  symptoms they may be feeling.</p>
