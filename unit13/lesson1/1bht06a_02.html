    <td><em>Aspergillus</em>, such as A. fumigatus and A. flavus, is a common mold found in soil, on plants, and in household dust.  When inhaled by people with weakened immune systems, the mold can cause a disease called aspergillosis, which produces respiratory symptoms and can damage tissues in the body.</td>

  <tr>
    <th>Histoplasma capsulatum</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The fungus <em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em> grows in soil and material contaminated with bat or bird droppings.  If disturbed, the soil or material releases airborne spores which can lead to an infection called histoplasmosis if inhaled.  While most infected people suffer no apparent ill effects, the fungus can cause acute respiratory disease which, if left untreated, can be fatal.  Antifungal medications are used to treat these severe cases.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Stachybotrys chartarum</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><em>Stachybotrys chartarum</em> (S. chartarum) is a common greenish-black mold also known as Stachybotrys atra.  It grows on materials such as fiberboard, gypsum board, and paper when constant moisture exists because of conditions like water leaks, excessive humidity, and condensation.  People who are sensitive to molds may experience strong allergic symptoms when exposed.  People with weakened immune systems may develop fungal infections in their lungs if exposed.</td>
