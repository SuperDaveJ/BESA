    <td>Botulinum toxins, the cause of botulism, are produced by the bacterium <em>Clostridium botulinum</em>.  Botulism is a rare but serious paralytic illness that can be transmitted by wound infections, intestinal infections in infants, or ingestion of improperly prepared food.  The most common sign of botulism is drooping eyelids.   Botulism can be treated with antitoxins and supportive care.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B (SEB) is one of several toxins produced by the <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> bacteria.  SEB thrives in unrefrigerated meats, dairy, and bakery products and is generally transmitted by eating contaminated foods.  In addition to commonly causing unintentional outbreaks of food poisoning, SEB can be aerosolized and thus used as a biological weapon as an incapacitating agent.</td>

    <td>The trichothecene (T-2) mycotoxins are compounds produced by fungi of the genus Fusarium, a common grain mold.  These toxins can be ingested if contaminated foods are eaten.  They can also be weaponized and dispersed through the air or mixed with food or beverages. </td>
