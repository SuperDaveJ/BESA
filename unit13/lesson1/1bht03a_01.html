<p class='popTitle'>Contact</p>
<p>Infections can be transmitted through direct or  indirect contact, including injection and absorption.&nbsp; Direct contact transmission can occur from  person-to-person contact which allows an infectious material to enter a receptive  site in the body.&nbsp; Indirect contact  transmission, or person-to-fomite transmission, occurs from touching a  contaminated surface.</p>
<p>For example, a person with a cold may spread the  illness by coughing into his hand and then shaking another person&rsquo;s hand  (person-to-person transmission) or touching a doorknob that is later used by  someone else (person-to-fomite transmission).</p>
