<p class='popTitle'>Fungi</p>
<p>Fungi are found in degrading organic matter and  include mushrooms, molds, and yeast.&nbsp; It  is important for you to be aware of the health threats related to fungi because  many Air Force facilities are older and have the potential for leaks or other  moisture problems which may promote the growth of mold.&nbsp; While removal of the mold by using bleach  solutions or discarding moldy materials is a necessary part of the cleanup  process, the most important action to take when mold is found in a building is  to remediate the source of the moisture that enabled the mold to grow.</p>
