  <tr>
    <th>Common Cold Viruses</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>More than 200 different viruses are known to cause the symptoms of the common cold.  People can become infected by cold viruses through contact or inhalation and generally recover with supportive treatment after a week or two.  Colds generally do not result in serious health problems, such as pneumonia, bacterial infections, or hospitalizations.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Ebola Virus</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The Ebola virus is an arbovirus that can be spread through contact with blood and/or secretions of an infected person and causes a severe, often fatal disease called Ebola hemorrhagic fever (Ebola HF).  No standard treatment for Ebola HF exists, and because the natural reservoir of the virus is unknown, there are few established prevention measures other than avoiding contact with infected people and observing universal precautions, such as wearing protective clothing and sterilizing equipment.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Influenza Virus</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses.  It can cause mild to severe illness and at time can lead to death.  Some complications that can result from the flu include pneumonia, bronchitis, and sinus and ear infections.  The best way people can avoid getting the flu is by receiving a flu vaccination each year.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus.  SARS was first reported in Asia in February, 2003.  Over the next few months, the illness spread to more than two dozen countries in North and South America, Europe, and Asia.  Before the global SARS outbreak was contained, over 8,000 people became ill and 774 died.  SARS seems to be spread mainly by close person-to-person contact and the virus is thought to be transmitted most readily by respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>West Nile Virus</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>West Nile virus (WNV) is a potentially serious arbovirus most commonly transmitted by infected mosquitoes.  Most infected people exhibit no symptoms, but some develop severe illness.  Milder WNV illness improves on its own without treatment, and only supportive treatments such as intravenous fluids exist for more severe WNV infections.  It is important to control the mosquito population through the use of insecticides and elimination of mosquito breeding grounds.  People can avoid being bitten through the use of protective clothing, screens, and insect repellant.</td>
