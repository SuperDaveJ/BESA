    <td>Cryptosporidiosis is a disease caused by microscopic parasites of the genus <em>Cryptosporidium</em>.  <em>Cryptosporidium</em> are most commonly found in water but may be found in soil or food, or on surfaces contaminated with the feces of an infected person or animal.  The most common symptom of cryptosporidiosis is diarrhea.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Malaria is caused by the Plasmodium genus of protozoal parasites and is transmitted by the bite of infected <em>Anopheles</em> mosquitoes.  Symptoms of the disease include high fevers, chills, other flu-like symptoms, and anemia.  Malaria is a major health concern in some tropical and subtropical areas such as South America, Africa, India, and Asia.  Anti-malarial chemoprophylaxis medications are typically prescribed to people traveling to areas where malaria is prevalent.  Other methods to prevent infection include controlling the mosquito population with insecticides and avoiding mosquito bites by wearing protective clothing and using screens and insect repellant.</td>

    <th>Toxoplasma gondii</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em> parasite causes a disease called toxoplasmosis which generally causes either no symptoms or flu-like symptoms such as swollen lymph glands or muscle aches.  People can become infected by eating undercooked, contaminated meat or by accidentally ingesting something that has come into contact with contaminated cat feces or soil.  Because infants can be infected while in the womb, pregnant women are cautioned to avoid handling litter boxes.</td>

    <th>Trichinella</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Trichinellosis, also known as trichinosis, is caused by eating raw or undercooked meat of animals infected with the larvae of a species of worm called <em>Trichinella</em>.  Trichinellosis causes a number of symptoms, including diarrhea, vomiting, and fever.  Infection is usually caused by eating undercooked pork and is relatively rare in the U.S.</td>
