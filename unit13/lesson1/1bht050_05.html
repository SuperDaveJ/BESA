<p class='popTitle'>Toxins</p>
<p>Toxins are poisonous substances which are  produced naturally by living organisms such as animals, plants, or  microbes.&nbsp; Once a toxin is introduced  into the body, treatment of symptoms will depend on the particular toxin.&nbsp; In some cases, anti-toxins can be  administered, but in other cases, the only treatment that can be offered is  supportive care such as ensuring hydration is maintained while the body  eliminates the toxin.&nbsp; </p>
