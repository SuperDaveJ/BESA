<p class='popTitle'>Radio Frequency Radiation (RFR) and Microwaves</p>
<p>Radio  Frequency Radiation (RFR) and microwave energy include the emissions from  broadcast facilities that transmit television and radio signals and are located  at the lower end of the electromagnetic spectrum.&nbsp; This type of energy is primarily used for  communications; however, it can also be used for weather surveillance, search  and detection radar, and remote control devices &ndash; all of which have applications  in Air Force operations and missions.</p>
<p>Health effects associated with RFR and microwaves  are thermal in nature.&nbsp;&nbsp; Surface tissue heating,  deep-tissue heating, microwave hearing effects, and damage to the eyes are all  health issues that may be associated with exposure to elevated levels of these  types of radiation.&nbsp; </p>
