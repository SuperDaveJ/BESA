<p class='popTitle'>Infrared, Visible, and Ultraviolet</p>
<p>Infrared  means &ldquo;below red&rdquo; and can be found at the lower energy end of visible  light.&nbsp;Infrared  radiation can be detected through the production of heat or thermal energy and  is produced by things such as food warmers, paint-drying lamps, and sunlamps.</p>
<p>Since  infrared is usually found in the form of heat or thermal energy, there are few  health concerns associated with this type of radiation.&nbsp; The primary health threats associated with  infrared radiation are produced by the shorter infrared wavelengths.&nbsp; The potential biological effects include damage  to the cornea, iris, retina, and lens of the eye.</p>
<p>Visible  non-ionizing energy occurs between infrared and ultraviolet radiation on the  electromagnetic spectrum.&nbsp; The  wavelengths that are visible to the eye are different for each individual, so  there is not one clear set point at which infrared radiation changes to visible  or where visible changes into ultraviolet radiation.</p>
<p>Ultraviolet  (UV) radiation is found at a higher energy level than visible light on the  electromagnetic spectrum.&nbsp; Common emitters  of UV radiation include the sun, tanning booths, and welding operations.&nbsp; UV radiation usually requires some form of  protection to prevent injury to humans.&nbsp;  For example, high intensity lamps are outfitted with glass shields  around them to prevent harmful exposures to UV radiation.&nbsp; The earth also includes a natural shield from  UV radiation emitted by the sun in the form of atmospheric gases and the ozone  layer in the stratosphere. </p>
