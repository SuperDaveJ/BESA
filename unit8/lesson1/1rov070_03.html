<p class='popTitle'>Neutron</p>
<p>Like alpha and beta radiation, neutrons are a particulate  form of radiation.&nbsp; However, neutrons are  encountered much less commonly than alpha or beta particles.&nbsp; Typically, they are only found when dealing  with nuclear reactors or weapons.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Unlike the alpha or beta particle, the neutron has  no electrical charge.&nbsp; Neutrons have variable  ranges based on the amount of kinetic energy present and how the neutrons were  produced.</p>
<p>Neutron radiation is the most penetrating type  of particulate ionizing radiation, requiring thick layers of concrete or water  for shielding purposes.&nbsp; This is  important for BE when considering appropriate controls to protect  personnel.&nbsp;</p>
