<p class='popTitle'>X-ray and Gamma</p>
<p>X-ray  and gamma radiation produce the highest amount of energy and are referred to as  the ionizing portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
<p>X-ray  and gamma radiation is indirectly ionizing, which means that any damage  sustained comes from by-products (e.g. free radicals) of the exposure caused  when the water of the body or of a cell absorbs the radiation.&nbsp; Potential health effects associated with  x-ray exposure could include cell membrane disruption or damage to cell  performance. </p>
