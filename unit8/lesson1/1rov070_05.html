<p class='popTitle'>Gamma</p>
<p>Gamma radiation is similar  to x-rays because it has no mass and no charge, and travels at the speed of  light.&nbsp; Unlike x-rays, which are emitted  from the electron cloud of an atom, gamma rays are emitted from the nucleus and  result when the nucleus transitions from a higher to lower energy state.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Although x-rays and gamma  rays are less ionizing than alpha, beta, and neutron particles, they have  greater penetrability than alpha and beta radiation.&nbsp; The most appropriate shielding material for gamma  radiation is typically lead.</p>
