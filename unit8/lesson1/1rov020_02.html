<p class='popTitle'>Energy</p>
<p>Energy is defined as the ability to do work.  The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy can be neither created nor destroyed but can change from one form to another.  In other words, the total amount of energy in a system remains constant and is neither increased nor decreased by any process but can be transformed into either potential or kinetic energy.</p>
