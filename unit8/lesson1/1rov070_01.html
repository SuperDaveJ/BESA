<p class='popTitle'>Alpha Particles (<em>&alpha;</em>)</p>
<p>An alpha particle is  heavy and slow compared to other types of radiation because it consists of two  neutrons and two protons.&nbsp; Its double  positive charge makes the alpha particle the heaviest ionizing radiation.&nbsp; It will strip electrons from other atoms or  temporarily pull them into a higher energy shell.&nbsp;An  alpha particle is formed when the nucleus is too heavy, meaning it does not  have enough neutrons.</p>
<p>Since it is a relatively large charged particle,  it interacts with matter within very short distances.&nbsp; Because of this, external shielding can be  accomplished with something as thin as a sheet of paper or the surface layer of  skin.&nbsp; Although easily shielded against,  the alpha particle is a concern for BE because it is the most ionizing of all  types of radiation and presents a significant health risk when alpha-emitting  material is ingested or inhaled.&nbsp;</p>
