<p class='popTitle'>X-rays</p>
<p>After an atom undergoes an alpha or beta decay, it  often leaves the nucleus in an excited state.&nbsp;  Then, when the atom transitions to a lower energy state, it produces  x-ray or gamma radiation.</p>
<p>X-rays are emitted from the electron shell and  are formed when electrons drop down from a higher shell to a lower shell.&nbsp; The electron gives up excess energy in the  form of an x-ray.&nbsp; X-rays have no mass  and no charge, and travel at the speed of light.&nbsp; They can pass through considerable amounts of  matter before interacting with it.&nbsp; Lead  can be used for shielding purposes when working with x-ray radiation. </p>
