<p class='popTitle'>Toxic Gases or Materials</p>
<p>The  presence of toxic gases or materials can occur from a variety of sources such  as a manufacturing process, storing a toxic product, or operations performed in  a confined space.&nbsp; Toxic atmospheres can  often lead to asphyxiation, or oxygen deprivation, for the personnel in a  confined space.</p>
<p>To  determine if a confined space has a potentially toxic atmosphere, you should  consider the following questions: </p>
<ul>
  <li>What did the space previously contain?</li>
  <li>What reactions could have occurred in the space?</li>
  <li>What operations will be performed in the space?</li>
  <li>What materials will be brought into the space?</li>
  <li>What materials may have inadvertently entered  the space?</li>
</ul>
