<p class='popTitle'>Safe Work Practices  </p>
<p>Safe work practices  ensure that all workers properly address the hazards associated with RFR.&nbsp; This includes verifying that required warning  signs and safety devices are in place or properly set before beginning work.</p>
<p>Work should always be  performed in a manner that keeps exposures to RFR as low as reasonably  achievable (ALARA), but always below the PEL.&nbsp;  Techniques that should be used to accomplish this include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ensuring all parties involved  understand the procedures and signals used for current operations. </li>
  <li>Reporting suspected or alleged  RFR overexposures to supervisors as well as the responsible area supervisor,  unit commander, and medical facility.</li>
  <li>Following guidance  regarding RFR in applicable technical orders (TOs), equipment manuals,  operation instructions (OIs) and Air Force standards, AFIs, regulations, and  policies.</li>
</ul>
