<p class='popTitle'>Constant Observation</p>
<p>Posting a qualified operator or technician to  observe the illuminated area during transmissions is a physical or  administrative control measure that may be implemented in instances where  permanent posting or roping off of an area is not feasible, such as during  field deployment exercises when posting requirements would compromise the  location of the unit or otherwise interfere with the mission.</p>
<p>Under normal conditions, an observer may not be  substituted for mandatory posting or other recommended controls. &nbsp;Constant observation is typically used in  conjunction with other control measures for added protection. </p>
