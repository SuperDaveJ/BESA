<p class='popTitle'>High Level Areas</p>
<p>In areas where personnel may have access to 10  times the controlled environment PEL, warning signs alone do not provide  adequate protection. Depending on the  potential risk of exposure, other warning devices are required, such as  flashing lights, audible signals, barriers, or interlocks.</p>
<p>The risks in such an area must be assessed by a  qualified BEE, who will provide written instructions which clearly document the  necessary control measures.</p>
<p>Without proper evaluation and approval by the  installation BEE, safety controls inherent in the equipment design, guidelines  established by other safety or measurement agencies, and requirements  established by the operational group may not be removed.</p>
