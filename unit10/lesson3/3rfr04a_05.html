<p class='popTitle'>Moderate Risk</p>
<p>A moderate risk rating  indicates a system which is capable of producing power densities in excess of  the PEL, but has controls in place to prohibit exposure to personnel under  normal operating conditions, tests, or maintenance procedures.</p>
<p>An example of a moderate-risk system is a TACAN  antenna found on most flying bases. If the antenna rotation slows down from the  design speed of 900 rpms, for any reason, the radiation emissions automatically  shut down.&nbsp; The system presents only a  moderate risk of exposure to personnel because, although it can produce levels  of energy above the PEL, the interlock system must fail before any significant  risk of exposure could reasonably occur.</p>
