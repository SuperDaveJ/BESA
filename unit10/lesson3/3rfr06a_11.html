<p class='popTitle'>Average Power (P<sub>avg</sub>)</p>
<p>The average power calculation applies to pulsed  systems only.&nbsp; The peak power (P<sub>p</sub>)  is used to calculate the average power (P<sub>avg</sub>) for such systems. (For  continuous wave systems, the peak power (P<sub>p</sub>) is the average power  and does not have to be calculated.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that data must be converted  to watts before this calculation can be performed properly.&nbsp; Typically the information needed to perform  the calculation is given in watts. However, if it is listed in joules you  should divide the pulse energy in joules by the pulse duration to get the  output energy in watts.</p>
<p>The formula used to calculate the average power (P<sub>avg</sub>)  is:</p>
<p>P<sub>avg</sub> = Peak Power (P<sub>p</sub>) x Duty  Factor (DF)</p>
