<p class='popTitle'>Gain</p>
<p>Gain, also referred to as directivity, is the  antenna&rsquo;s ability to concentrate its energy in a certain direction.&nbsp; The gain is expressed in decibels (dB) and is  used to calculate the absolute gain.</p>
<p>Large gains mean the beam is smaller and the energy is  more concentrated.&nbsp; Small gains mean the  beam is wider and the energy is spread out further.&nbsp; Generally, the higher gain antennas are more  hazardous due to the concentrated energy.</p>
