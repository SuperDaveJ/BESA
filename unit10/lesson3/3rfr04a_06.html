<p class='popTitle'>High Risk</p>
<p>A high risk rating is  applied to systems with average power densities at or above the PEL that can be  accessed by personnel during normal operating conditions, routine tests, and/or  maintenance procedures.&nbsp; Signs, rope  barriers, cones, or other control measures must be posted prior to transmitting  with these types of systems.</p>
<p>An example of a high-risk  system would be nose-mounted radar on small aircraft, where the beam is  accessible from the ground and routinely operated in a stationary mode for  maintenance or testing while other maintenance personnel are working on or near  the aircraft. </p>
