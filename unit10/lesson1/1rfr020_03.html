<p class='popTitle'>Energy</p>
<p>The  amount of energy produced is determined based on the relationship between  wavelength and frequency.&nbsp; For instance,  each wavelength cycle has the same amount of energy.&nbsp; Because of this, the amount of energy  produced is determined by the number of cycles that can fit inside the time  span of one second.&nbsp; Due to this  relationship, as frequency increases, the energy increases and the wavelength  gets shorter.</p>
<p>The amount of energy produced is described using  electron volts (eV).</p>
