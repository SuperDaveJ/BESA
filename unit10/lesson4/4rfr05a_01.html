<p class='popTitle'>Perform an Initial Estimation of the Exposure</p>
<p>While performing an initial estimation of the  exposure, you should gather all information currently known about the  incident.&nbsp; This would include considering  the type of emitter and the potential for the individual to be exposed to RFR  above the PEL.</p>
<p>When determining if a person has received an exposure  in excess of the PEL, you need to consider the average exposure time and  whole-body spatial averaging that could be associated with the incident.</p>
