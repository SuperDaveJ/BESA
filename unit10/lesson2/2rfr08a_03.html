<p class='popTitle'>Athermal Effects</p>
<p>Biological effects not associated with thermal  absorption may occur, although they have not been well-documented.&nbsp; Low levels of RFR have been found to cause  alteration in animal behavior or changes in the functioning of cell membranes. Examples  of these athermal effects may include immune system alterations and cancer.</p>
<p>These effects cannot be substantiated by leading  Air Force, industry, or academic scientists. &nbsp;While the Air Force is not discounting the  remote possibility of athermal effects, not enough data has been collected to  establish a set of standards based upon observed athermal effects. Therefore,  the current Air Force standard for RFR is designed to protect personnel from  known thermal hazards associated with RFR emissions.</p>
