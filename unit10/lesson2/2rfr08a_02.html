<p class='popTitle'>Indirect Effects</p>
<p>Aside from the health effects caused directly by  the RFR energy, personnel <br />
  and equipment may be subject to additional hazards  associated with RFR emitter operation.</p>
<p>Electromagnetic interference is an indirect RFR  hazard which can lead to the reprogramming or disruption of  microprocessor-controlled medical devices such as pacemakers.&nbsp; RFR energy can produce arcs which could ignite  combustible gases or flammable materials.&nbsp;  Many aircraft weapon systems use small explosive devices that are  detonated by an electric current, often in order to detonate larger  devices.&nbsp; Electromagnetic interference  can inadvertently set off one of these devices.</p>
<p>High voltage is an ancillary hazard associated  with RFR emitters that can cause a potentially lethal electrical shock.&nbsp; Strong electric fields, such as those  produced in high-powered radar systems, can create x-ray emissions.&nbsp; Some systems may include sources of  strong-static and low-frequency DC magnetic fields which can cause injury due  to rapid movement of metal objects.</p>
