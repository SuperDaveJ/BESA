<p class='popTitle'>Direct / Thermal Effects</p>
<p>Direct effects are primarily thermal and occur due  to the absorption of electromagnetic energy which results in excessive heating  of the affected area.&nbsp; Examples of direct  effects include increased tissue heating, the microwave hearing effect, and  induced current.</p>
<p>Increased tissue heating, also known as deep  heating, occurs when energy is absorbed into the body&rsquo;s tissues.&nbsp; This type of effect can burn or irritate the  surface level of skin, or it can damage the body&rsquo;s internal tissues.&nbsp; Since internal organs have no heat sensors,  deep heating of the body tissue is more hazardous than surface heating because  the person cannot feel the effects of the exposure to take corrective  actions.</p>
<p>Another direct effect is the microwave hearing  effect, which is the sensation of a clicking, buzzing, or chirping sound which  seems to originate within or near the head.&nbsp;  This type of effect is often the result of exposure to pulsed wave  emitters.</p>
<p>Induced currents are direct effects which occur when a  current passes through the body and creates burns at the point of contact.&nbsp; Induced currents only occur with emitters operating  at less than 100 MHz. </p>
