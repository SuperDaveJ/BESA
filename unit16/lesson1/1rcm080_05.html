<p class='popTitle'>Differences Between Military and Civilian Culture</p>
<p>When communicating risk to a civilian or mixed  population, the difference between military and civilian culture can be a key  factor.&nbsp; The military&rsquo;s command and  control culture can be interpreted as not open to debate and, therefore, can  cause an audience to view the military as uninterested in the well-being of  external stakeholders. </p>
<p>Strategies  for overcoming the perceptions caused by differences between military and  civilian culture include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tailoring the use of language and presentation to meet your audience&rsquo;s  level of understanding and perspective on the situation.</li>
  <li>Addressing uncertainty about the risk while keeping  your key messages clear and concise.</li>
  <li>Telling  your stakeholders what information you do have as well as what you do not know.</li>
</ul>
