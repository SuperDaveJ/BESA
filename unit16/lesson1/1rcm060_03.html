<p class='popTitle'>Be Cautious When Using Risk Comparisons</p>
<p>It can be helpful to place risks in perspective by comparing an  unfamiliar risk to a similar, more familiar, one.&nbsp; However, some types of comparisons are not  appropriate.&nbsp; You should avoid comparing <em>unrelated</em> risks because they don&rsquo;t help people understand  the risk they are currently encountering.&nbsp;  You should also avoid comparing voluntary risks, such as smoking, to  those that are not voluntary, such as drinking contaminated water.&nbsp; The confusion caused by these inappropriate  risk comparisons can lead to distrust and fear.</p>
<p>For example, you should avoid comparing something familiar, like mold,  to an unfamiliar chemical such as toluene.&nbsp; While both can irritate the  upper respiratory system, toluene can cause severe internal physiological  damage.&nbsp; Because the substances and effects are mostly unrelated, your  audience may view you as untrustworthy and could then ignore your  recommendations.</p>
<p>Refer to the table below for examples of appropriate  risk comparisons.</p>
