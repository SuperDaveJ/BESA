<p class='popTitle'>Example of Ineffective Health Risk Communication</p>
<p>A partial meltdown of  a reactor core at Three Mile Island on March  28, 1979, caused wide-spread public panic because the incident was not  immediately communicated with the public.&nbsp;  There was no risk of radiation exposure to the public, but because of  the lack of effective, honest, and upfront communication, the community felt  they were at risk and the company operating the facility lost all credibility  with the public.</p>
<p>The lesson learned  from this incident is that it is necessary to inform all appropriate parties  who may be affected by a risk in an honest, open, and timely fashion.&nbsp; Additionally, when there is a potential or  perceived risk inherent with an activity or facility, initial and ongoing  effective communication helps people feel informed and secure.</p>
