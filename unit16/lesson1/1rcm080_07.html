<p class='popTitle'>Perception of Reactive vs. Proactive Communication</p>
<p>A widely held perception  of government is that it operates from a reactive rather than proactive  perspective.&nbsp; This perception also holds true  related to communicating health risks.&nbsp;  This perception can be compounded because the military&rsquo;s organizational  structure affects the flow of communication. </p>
<p>Strategies  for overcoming perceptions of reactive vs. proactive communication include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Providing open and honest communication about what is known and unknown  about a risk at the given time, as quickly as possible. </li>
  <li>Addressing the immediately affected stakeholders quickly and with  information related to appropriate actions.</li>
  <li>Using understandable, clear, and concise language so that the audience  can obtain a good perspective of the situation and what is being done to  mitigate the risk.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Being well-prepared to address an audience with the  potential questions or concerns that may be presented.</li>
</ul>
