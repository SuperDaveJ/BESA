<p class='popTitle'>Public Discomfort with Scientific Information</p>
<p>When communicating health risk, you may find that your  audience experiences varying degrees of discomfort with scientific information.&nbsp; This is due to society&rsquo;s typically low  tolerance for risk and the public&rsquo;s desire for certainty, even when some facts  may not actually be available.&nbsp; This  challenge is often intensified by the public&rsquo;s access to the internet which facilitates  a perception that information should be accessible immediately.</p>
<p>Strategies  for overcoming public discomfort with scientific information include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Providing open and honest communication that explains sources and reasons  for any uncertainty.</li>
  <li>Providing your professional judgment when all of the facts are not known  about a given risk.</li>
  <li>Ensuring your key messages are understandable, clear,  and concise for the audience.</li>
</ul>
