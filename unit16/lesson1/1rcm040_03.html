<p class='popTitle'>Providing Practical and Effective Information and Recommendations</p>
<p>For health  risk communication to be valuable, your audience must receive information in a  practical and effective manner that enables decision making.&nbsp; If the communication delivered is too  conceptual in nature, it may not contain specific information your  audience needs.&nbsp; Messages that are too  technical in nature may be misunderstood, decreasing the effectiveness of the  message.</p>
<p>Remember these main  points: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Develop  and limit key messages (usually 3 or less) so the important points don&rsquo;t get  lost in extraneous details.</li>
  <li>Talk about  what matters to your audience in language that makes sense to them. </li>
  <li>Be prepared to  discuss the topic and show empathy and willingness to address audience  concerns.</li>
  <li>Build trust  and honesty by providing accurate information; addressing relevant issues,  options, and recommendations; and abiding by promises.</li>
  <li>Be aware of communication that is based on risk  perception, agendas, or emotions and address those issues honestly.</li>
  <li>The  most effective risk communication involves two-way dialogue with your audience.</li>
</ul>
