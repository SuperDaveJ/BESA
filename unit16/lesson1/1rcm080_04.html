<p class='popTitle'>Lack of Public Trust in Government</p>
<p>Public  stakeholders may not trust government agencies, including the military.&nbsp; These perceptions can be traced back to  Watergate and Vietnam,  for instance, and continue to affect communication with various stakeholders.&nbsp; It is important to recognize that public  trust is not transferable from one individual to another or from one program to  another.&nbsp; Even though public opinion may  be higher in a &ldquo;pro-military&rdquo; community, communicators must treat every message  and meeting as an opportunity to build trust and credibility with their  audience.</p>
<p>Strategies  for overcoming a lack of public trust in government include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Communicating honestly, even when all the facts are not available.</li>
  <li>Using your professional judgment when appropriate.</li>
  <li>Being prepared to communicate with your audience and  answer their questions and concerns.</li>
</ul>
