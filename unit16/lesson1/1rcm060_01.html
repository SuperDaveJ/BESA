<p class='popTitle'>Communicate Clearly and Honestly</p>
<p>While communicating  to your audience, you should provide verbal and nonverbal messages that convey  empathy, honesty, and commitment.&nbsp;  Whenever possible, you should provide familiar examples and concrete  information that can help place the risk in perspective.</p>
<p>You should always present information to the  audience&rsquo;s level of understanding.&nbsp; If an  audience perceives the information being presented as too difficult to  understand or too technical in nature, they will often reject the communicator  as being dishonest or untrustworthy.&nbsp; For  example, using multiple acronyms or sampling data without well-defined  explanations may lose your audience.&nbsp; As  a result, they may refuse to acknowledge the information or become  hostile.&nbsp; An audience may also become  hostile if they feel they are being patronized.&nbsp; Knowing your audience is the key.&nbsp; </p>
