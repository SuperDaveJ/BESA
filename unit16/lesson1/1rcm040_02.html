<p class='popTitle'>Communicating the Right Information to the Right People, at the Right Time</p>
<p>When  communicating health risk information, make sure the appropriate message is  made available to the right people at the right time. &nbsp;You can best convey information that is  meaningful for your specific audience by developing key messages. &nbsp;While technical details may be important in  certain situations, generally, your audience is mostly concerned with how the  current risk affects them and what they need to do to protect themselves.</p>
<p>For example, if lead  paint were found in base housing, you wouldn&rsquo;t initiate communication to the  affected community by comparing lead paint to the health effects of mold.&nbsp; This could cause them to think of you as  dishonest or untrustworthy because the message could be viewed as a way to  justify the risk  as irrelevant.</p>
<p>The right information  has no benefit unless the appropriate people receive that information.&nbsp; If an order is given to discontinue use of a  particular respirator to all shop workers on base, even though the only risk  that exists is with workers in one shop performing a certain type of work, this  may cause widespread concern to individuals that are not affected by the risk.</p>
<p>Finally, the timeliness of communication is  vital to ensuring the value  it has for your audience.&nbsp; If your audience is not notified at the  appropriate time, they may be delayed in taking actions to mitigate their  exposure to the risk.&nbsp;For  example, if a water main break occurs on base that only affects certain  locations, you should notify the affected areas as soon as possible so they  immediately begin using an alternate source of potable water.</p>
