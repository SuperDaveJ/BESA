<p class='popTitle'>Deal with Uncertainty</p>
<p>When communicating  health risks, the results may not be definitive.&nbsp; You should discuss sources of uncertainty,  such as the methods for gathering, analyzing, and interpreting data as long as  the message is still easy to understand and relevant to the audience.&nbsp; By following this process, you acknowledge  that uncertainties are recognized, which can lead to an increase in trust.</p>
<p>When discussing uncertainty, you may need to  subtly identify your expertise and knowledge of the subject.&nbsp; This becomes important when communicating  with the community or discussing situations with shop personnel who may not be  aware of your qualifications.&nbsp; If you  have already built a relationship with a high level of trust with your  audience, you may find discussing uncertainties somewhat easier.&nbsp; </p>
