<p class='popTitle'>Ineffective Health Risk Communication</p>
<p>In  the event that risk is communicated ineffectively, the consequences can be  disastrous for all parties involved.&nbsp; Decision-makers  are unable to react to dynamic circumstances appropriately because the  information or recommendations presented were either not conveyed to the  correct person(s) or were conveyed in a way that was unclear.&nbsp; Ineffective health risk communication to the  public or affected populations can cause panic, distrust, continued anxiety, or  inaction when action is necessary.</p>
