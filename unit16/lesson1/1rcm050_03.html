<p class='popTitle'>Example of Effective Health Risk Communication</p>
<p>In October, 1982,  there were several deaths attributed to product tampering of Johnson &amp;  Johnson&rsquo;s Tylenol pain reliever.&nbsp; The capsules  had been filled with cyanide and placed on store shelves.&nbsp; When incidents began occurring, Tylenol  promptly notified the public, removed all of their products from store shelves,  and began a constant communication campaign with the public about the situation  where they accepted responsibility for the situation and apologized.&nbsp; Their communication campaign focused on  public safety, well-being, and regaining the public&rsquo;s trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the products were introduced back into the  market, Johnson &amp; Johnson added various tamper resistant features to their packaging  and implemented sales and marketing techniques that included presentations to  the medical community with the intent for the public to regain confidence in  their brand.&nbsp; Because of Johnson &amp;  Johnson&rsquo;s effective communication with the public, they were able to maintain a  positive relationship with stakeholders and restore confidence in their product. </p>
