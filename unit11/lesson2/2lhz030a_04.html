<p class='popTitle'>Thermal  Damage</p>
<p>Thermal damage is brought about by the temperature  elevation of a substance due to laser exposure.&nbsp;  This occurs when a steady stream of photons is absorbed by the tissue  until the natural cooling ability of the tissue is overwhelmed and its  temperature rises to damaging levels.</p>
<p>
  For example, when a laser hits the cornea and lens  of an eye, it causes a cataract-like heating effect that damages the eye.&nbsp; The common health effects associated with  thermal damage include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Permanent retinal damage.</li>
  <li>Short-term tissue damage.</li>
  <li>Energy absorption and heat build-up.</li>
  <li>Long-term heat build-up from a sustained exposure.</li>
</ul>
