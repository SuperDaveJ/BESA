<p class='popTitle'>Document Results and Reprioritize Additional Sampling Based on Results</p>
<p>You document the results  of your screening samples.&nbsp; Screening results for  VOCs are negative.</p>
<p>Based  on the workers&rsquo; complaints of a &ldquo;rotten egg&rdquo; odor, you screened for hydrogen  sulfide but did not detect its presence (the 4-gas  meter detection limit is 1 ppm).&nbsp; You  suspect that concentrations less than 1 ppm but above the odor threshold of  .008 ppm are likely present.</p>
<p>Based on the  presence of the &ldquo;rotten egg&rdquo; smell and the results of the 1999 landfill  investigation, you decide to take additional samples for lab analysis even  though screening samples did not detect hydrogen sulfide or VOCs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the results come back  from the lab, you will document them and consider whether additional sampling  is required.</p>
