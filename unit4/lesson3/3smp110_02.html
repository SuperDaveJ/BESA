<p class='popTitle'>Type of Sample (Disturbed or Undisturbed)</p>
<p>Depending on your  method, the sample you collect may be disturbed or undisturbed.</p>
<p>A disturbed sample is  one whose internal structure has been damaged to such a degree that it does not  reasonably approximate that of the material in situ (in its original position).</p>
<p>An undisturbed sample is a sample obtained and  handled in such a way that disturbance of its original structure is minimal so  that the sample is suitable for laboratory tests of material properties that  depend on in situ soil structure.</p>
