<p class='popTitle'>Compositing Samples</p>
<p>Compositing is the  process of physically combining and homogenizing several individual soil  aliquots, or portions, in order to provide an average concentration of  contaminants over a certain number of sampling points.&nbsp; This technique can be very useful, reducing  the number of required lab analyses, but it must always be implemented with  caution.</p>
<p>Since compositing dilutes high concentration  aliquots, the applicable method detection limit (MDL) should be reduced  accordingly. If the composite value is to be compared to a selected limit, then  the limit must be divided by the number of aliquots that make up the composite  in order to determine the appropriate MDL.&nbsp;  For example, if the limit for a particular substance is 50 ppb, a limit of  10 ppb should be used when analyzing a 5-aliquot composite. The MDL need not be  reduced if the composite area is assumed to be homogeneous in concentration. </p>
