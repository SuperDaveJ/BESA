<p class='popTitle'>Biased / Haphazard Sampling</p>
<p>Biased sampling, also known as haphazard  sampling, is used when information is available that suggests specific  contamination exists in specific areas of a site. &nbsp;The sampling locations are chosen based on that  information; therefore, this type of sampling often leads to biased  results.&nbsp; This approach is typically used  as a preliminary screening technique to identify a possible problem before full-scale  sampling is done.</p>
