<p class='popTitle'>Soil Type</p>
<p>The sampling  equipment you can use is affected by the type of soil.&nbsp; For example, you may not be able to use tube  samplers in rocky soils.&nbsp; Also, because  some soil types do not absorb contaminants, you must know what type of soil  you&rsquo;re dealing with in order to sample the correct locations.&nbsp; For example, chemicals may be found several  hundred feet from the source of contamination if the soil is a porous,  non-organic type such as sand that allows for rapid movement of liquids.</p>
<p>The subsurface lithology (the presence and  location of different types of soil, bedrock, or groundwater) of the site  strongly influences the transport of hazardous chemicals.&nbsp; Soil features such as color, texture, and  structure should be described as a function of depth at each sample  location.&nbsp; Soils high in organic material  can absorb and concentrate some hazardous chemicals.&nbsp; For example, a layer of peat may be more  contaminated than the soil layers above or below it.</p>
