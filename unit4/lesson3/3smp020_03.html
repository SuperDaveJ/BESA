<p class='popTitle'>Remediation</p>
<p>Remediation sampling is performed during or after a cleanup process in  order to determine the success of cleanup operations and to determine whether  the levels of contamination pose a risk to public health or the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Although  there are generally no specific federal guidelines to follow when conducting  soil sampling, numerical standards have been developed by regulators to  establish criteria for some soil cleanup operations that are similar in  nature.&nbsp; For example, the EPA has  established specific corrective action levels for lead in soil located in  residential communities.&nbsp; If specific  numerical standards don&rsquo;t exist, the regulator may choose to apply Resource  Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure  (TCLP) levels to the site and treat the soil as a potential hazardous waste.&nbsp; TCLP is an analysis procedure used to  demonstrate how much contaminant leaches from the soil due to normal  weathering.</p>
<p>Remember,  verifying compliance with remediation regulations is not a BE role.</p>
