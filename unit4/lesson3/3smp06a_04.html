<p class='popTitle'>Systematic Grid Sampling</p>
<p>The most common statistical approach is systematic  grid sampling.&nbsp; This method involves  collecting samples at predetermined, regular intervals.&nbsp; The location of the first sampling point is  selected at random, and all subsequent sampling locations are determined using  a systematic pattern from that point.&nbsp;  The grid-based option minimizes bias, provides complete site coverage,  and is especially useful for large sites. &nbsp;The most basic grid system is a straight line  between two points on which regularly spaced sampling locations are designated.  &nbsp;However, most sampling requires a  two-dimensional grid system, such as square or triangle grids, for locating  sampling points.</p>
<p>You can also tailor a systematic grid  sampling strategy to search for hot spots, which are areas characterized by  high contaminant concentrations.&nbsp; A hot  spot sampling plan should consider grid spacing and geometry to be  successful.&nbsp; A triangular grid pattern  increases the efficiency of the hot spot search.</p>
<p>Background data from events such as spills  or leaks usually triggers the need for hot spot sampling and drives the  selection of the sampling area and grid pattern in order to identify the extent  of the contamination.</p>
<p>Validity of search sampling depends on  accuracy of prior information on when and where to begin the search and  accuracy of measurements over time or space to guide the search.</p>
