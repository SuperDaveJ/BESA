<p class='popTitle'>Depth</p>
<p>Soil contamination by  elemental heavy metals, such as lead, or by chemicals that are relatively  insoluble in water, such as pesticides, may be limited to the top few inches of  soil.&nbsp; However, the area that is  contaminated can be affected by soil erosion, weather, vehicular movement, or  disturbance of the soil.</p>
<p>Soil contamination by  soluble metals (e.g., plating wastes) or by spills of concentrated organic  chemicals (e.g., gasoline, aviation fuel, solvents, or transformer oil) may  extend to considerable depths.&nbsp; The concentration  of the chemicals at any depth may not be easily predictable.</p>
<p>Depending on the analytes being investigated,  samples are collected at the surface (0-3 in.), extended surface (0-6 in.),  and/or at one-foot depth intervals.</p>
