<p class='popTitle'>Stratified Random Sampling</p>
<p>Another statistical sampling approach is stratified random  sampling, in which you apply existing data or background information to divide a site into different sampling areas or  strata that are internally homogenous. &nbsp;This technique is useful for  investigating large sites that encompass a number of soil types, topographic  features, or land uses.&nbsp; The division of  the site is based on the assumption that each stratum is more internally  homogenous than the site as a whole. &nbsp;Strata can be defined based on various factors  including sampling depth, contaminant concentration levels, and contaminant  source areas.</p>
<p>The data from each  stratum may be used to determine the mean or total contaminant concentration  within the stratum and comparisons between the different strata, or it may be  combined to provide information about the entire site.&nbsp; The same random site selection procedures are  used within each stratum as in simple random sampling.</p>
