<p class='popTitle'>Site-Specific Risk Assessment</p>
<p>A site-specific risk assessment is a scientific estimation of a human  health or ecological hazard required by regulators.&nbsp; Although BE is not responsible for conducting  a site-specific risk assessment, your installation may be required to collect  representative samples from the spill site and have the samples analyzed for  hazardous substances.&nbsp; This assessment  sampling is done prior to any remediation.</p>
<p>The ultimate outcome of the site-specific risk  assessment is the degree of risk, which is then compared to acceptable risk  values established by regulators.&nbsp; The  risk assessment identifies the degree of site control needed, cleanup goals,  type of treatment, and an estimate of the health threat.</p>
