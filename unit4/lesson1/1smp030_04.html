<p class='popTitle'>Compliance Assessment</p>
<p>Compliance assessments are performed where required  by program management regulations such as for respiratory protection, hazard  communication, confined spaces, and others.&nbsp;  These assessments are to determine program status and are only performed  in garrison as a part of the routine assessment. However, specific compliance  standards, such as drinking water standards, must also be adhered to during  deployment settings.</p>
<p>Compliance assessments are performed with three objectives:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To protect and enhance human health.</li>
  <li>To assist commanders in complying with  federal, state, local, and Air Force OEH regulations, standards, and policy.</li>
  <li>To increase mission  effectiveness through fact-based risk management decision making.</li>
</ul>
