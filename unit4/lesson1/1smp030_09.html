<p class='popTitle'>Health Risk Communication</p>
<p>Health risk communication is a  mechanism to convey health hazard information, workplace exposures, compliance  assessments, and other health risks to workers, commanders, and medical staff. Health  risk communication is performed at all levels of the assessment process through  a multitude of means and can be as simple as making a phone call or as detailed  as completion of an initial survey report describing all facets of an  industrial operation.</p>
<p>The unit or squadron commander must  be well-informed to make decisions regarding control strategies. &nbsp;You also  need to remain informed about new or changed workplaces or processes, illness  or injury data, adverse occupational health exam trends, or concerns raised by  members of the unit. &nbsp;Remember to document all health risk communication.</p>
