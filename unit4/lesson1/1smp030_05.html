<p class='popTitle'>Risk Reduction Strategies (Prioritization)</p>
<p>Prioritize assessment needs in order to maximize the time and resources  you have available.&nbsp; This prioritization  of viable exposures is used as the basis for the overall sampling  strategy.&nbsp; Once the Areas of Concern  (AOCs) and their respective exposure hazards have been identified and  infeasible exposure pathways eliminated, you should determine the risk rating  and rank of each exposure pathway.</p>
<p>Only AOCs with complete or  potentially complete exposure pathways are evaluated and given a risk  rating.&nbsp; For the exposure pathway to be  complete, the media, activity or point of exposure, and exposure route all must  be present.&nbsp;A potentially complete  pathway is one in which a gap in the data exists so that a follow-up  assessment, such as sampling or biological monitoring, is required to determine  whether the pathway is complete.&nbsp; Incomplete pathways are documented but  eliminated from further evaluation.</p>
