<p class='popTitle'>Definition of Scope </p>
<p>When conducting routine assessment, first you must define the scope of  support and resources needed.&nbsp; You must perform  routine assessment in newly identified industrial shops within three months  of identification to establish a foundation upon which to base future  assessments.&nbsp; You may need to meet with  commanders of organizations or their representatives to identify their mission  requirements, relative pace of military operations (&ldquo;ops tempo&rdquo;), and concerns  for the health of their members.</p>
<p>At times, you will receive unscheduled requests regarding potential  health risks identified from outside the routine assessment process which  must be prioritized for appropriate evaluation. &nbsp;Examples of unscheduled requests are occupational  illness or injury reports, pregnancy evaluations, and individual  complaints.</p>
<p>Defining the scope involves  programming and budgeting for required manpower, equipment, and supplies, as  well as scheduling and suspensing. </p>
