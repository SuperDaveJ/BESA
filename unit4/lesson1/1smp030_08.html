<p class='popTitle'>Exposure Assessment</p>
<p>The next step in the special assessment process  is collecting exposure assessment data.&nbsp; The  primary reason for performing an assessment is to increase confidence in  controls or hazard characterization. &nbsp;Confidence  in controls is a qualitative (and sometimes quantitative) assessment of how  well and how consistently the hazard is controlled. &nbsp;In some ways, this measures the probability of  the control to prevent exposures.</p>
<p>In determining your confidence in hazard  characterization, a number of factors should be considered. &nbsp;These factors include sampling and analytical  error, variability in sampling results, similarity to results from similar  operations, and representation of the activity analyzed.</p>
