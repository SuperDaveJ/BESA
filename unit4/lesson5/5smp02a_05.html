<p class='popTitle'>Potentiation</p>
<p>Potentiation  is a dependent action in which a substance or physical agent at a concentration  or dose that does not itself have an adverse effect enhances the harm done by  another substance. In other words, a contaminant that does not normally have a  toxic effect could become toxic when combined with another contaminant.&nbsp; This kind of effect could be represented as <em>0+1= 5</em>.</p>
