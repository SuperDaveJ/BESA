<p class='popTitle'>Example of Considering Standards, Mission Accomplishment, and Health Effects</p>
<p>Because  the Super Guppy had not been repainted in over ten years, the corrosion control  work on this aircraft was a high priority.&nbsp;  The Super Guppy is the only aircraft of its kind and is necessary to  transport components of the Space Station, as well as other large items  critical to the space program.</p>
<p>Based on the Super Guppy&rsquo;s importance to NASA&rsquo;s  mission and a comparison of the screening results with applicable standards,  the Commander chose to allow the workers to continue the painting process  without having the lab results in hand.</p>
