<p class='popTitle'>Antagonism</p>
<p>Antagonism  refers to the interference or inhibition of the effect of one chemical by the  action of another chemical.&nbsp; Therefore,  the combined effect of the chemicals is less than the sum of their individual  effects.&nbsp; When antagonism occurs, one  contaminant could reduce the effect of the other chemical, or both contaminants  could interfere with each other, in effect canceling each other out.&nbsp; This effect could be represented by the equation, <em>1+1= 0</em>.</p>
