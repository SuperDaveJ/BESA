<p class='popTitle'>Area Sampling</p>
<p>Area  sampling, also known as general air sampling, can be used to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Evaluate background concentrations.</li>
  <li>Locate sources of exposure, including exposures  from adjacent work areas or upwind off-base activities. </li>
  <li>Evaluate the effectiveness of control measures (e.g.,  paint booth ventilation system).&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>The  sampling device is strategically placed in a fixed location in the area of  interest. &nbsp;For example, if an airborne chemical  release is suspected in an activity, several area samples taken at key  locations could be used to pinpoint the source.</p>
<p>Another way area sampling can be used is to  determine changes in the air quality throughout a workday.&nbsp; For instance, if you take background area  samples in a welding shop before the process, those results will help you  identify the increase of contaminants within that shop while the process is  being performed.</p>
<p>In general, area sampling is not used to provide an  estimate of worker exposure because conditions at the fixed location may not be  the same as those experienced by the worker.&nbsp;  Rather, it is used as a screening tool to determine the presence or  absence of a contaminant.&nbsp; It cannot be  compared to established breathing zone standards and is not typically used for  compliance purposes.</p>
