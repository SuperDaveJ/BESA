<p class='popTitle'>Compliance</p>
<p>Compliance sampling provides a tool to ensure that regulations  and standards are met and provides support for documentation of compliance or  noncompliance.&nbsp; It is used to get a more  accurate evaluation of the worker&rsquo;s exposure than screening can provide and is  an indirect method consistent with OSHA or NIOSH.</p>
<p>BE must ensure that the sample volume and sample  duration provide meaningful results.&nbsp; Compliance  samples should be collected in accordance with applicable standards for the  duration of the shift minus one hour, as a minimum.</p>
<p>Samples are collected over periods of time  representing all parts of the day that a worker can be exposed. This means you  must calculate a time-weighted average using the results of the air samples in  order to compare them to the occupational exposure limit.</p>
<p>All compliance samples must be analyzed by a lab  certified by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) unless the  major command (MAJCOM) or equivalent allows the use of a specific noncertified  laboratory.</p>
