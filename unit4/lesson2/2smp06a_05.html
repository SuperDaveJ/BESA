<p class='popTitle'>Personal Sampling</p>
<p>Personal  sampling is the most accurate method of evaluating and quantifying a worker&rsquo;s  exposure to airborne chemicals, as it is representative of the worker&rsquo;s  exposure to a contaminant throughout the day.</p>
<p>During  personal sampling, the worker wears a sampling device that collects an air  sample. &nbsp;The sampling device is placed as  close as possible to the route of entry in the breathing zone of the worker,  within 6&ndash;9 inches of the nose and mouth, so the data collected closely  represents the concentration being inhaled.</p>
<p>Because personal samples are collected over a period of time according  to a standard, they can be used for compliance purposes.</p>
