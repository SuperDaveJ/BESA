<p class='popTitle'>Time Weighted Average (OEL-TWA)</p>
<p>The  time-weighted average (TWA) is the concentration to which it is believed that  nearly all workers may be repeatedly exposed, 8 hours per day, 40 hours per  week, without adverse health effects.&nbsp;  This means you must average the results of any air samples you have  taken over the workshift in order to compare them to the OEL-TWA.&nbsp; The OEL-TWA is established for chemicals with  long term (chronic) health effects.</p>
