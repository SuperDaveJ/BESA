<p class='popTitle'>Particulate Matter (PM)</p>
<p>Particulate  matter (PM) is a complex mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found  in air. &nbsp;These small particles can lead  to a variety of health problems because they can be respired into the deep  lung.</p>
<p>These  solid and liquid particles come in a wide range of sizes.&nbsp; Inhalable coarse particles are less than 10  micrometers in diameter (PM10).&nbsp;  Fine particles, which are less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM2.5),  are believed to pose the greatest health risks, including long-term exposure  effects.</p>
<p>For both fine  and coarse particles, the EPA has set two types of standards: primary  standards, to protect public health; and secondary standards, to protect the  public welfare from effects including visibility impairment, damage to building  and national monuments, and damage to ecosystems.</p>
