<p class='popTitle'>Direct Reading Instruments (DRIs)</p>
<p>Direct Reading Instruments (DRIs) allow an  immediate measurement of the concentration of a contaminant and are often used  for screening. &nbsp;Air contaminants are  analyzed within the instrument and the concentration results are read through a  digital or analog readout.</p>
<p>DRIs are very beneficial in that they can provide  on-the-spot information and are ideal when you need immediate data. &nbsp;DRIs can profile fluctuations in contaminant  concentrations that are lost when performing traditional integrated sampling.</p>
<p>When appropriate, DRIs may be used in compliance  sampling, but confirmatory analysis must be provided by a lab.</p>
<p>The selection of the appropriate DRI will depend on  the application for which it will be used and no single instrument can be used  to measure all contaminants in the air. It is important to remember that the  DRIs available for in garrison and deployed operations can often be used to  assess the health risk. All instruments are designed to be used within a  designated detection range so you need to calibrate it according to the manufacturer&rsquo;s  instructions before use.</p>
