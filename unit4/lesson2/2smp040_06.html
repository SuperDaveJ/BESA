<p class='popTitle'>Screening</p>
<p>Screening can be thought of as a quick snapshot to  provide an initial estimate of worker exposure.&nbsp;  Screening samples should evaluate each potential health threat to a  similar exposure group (SEG).&nbsp;  Professional judgment dictates the number of screening samples to be  taken.</p>
<p>Screening samples are often collected using direct  reading instruments (DRIs) with the understanding that there are errors and  limits of detection involved. &nbsp;An  integrated sample collected over only a short term, using a NIOSH method, can  also be considered a screening sample.</p>
<p>Screening samples can be used to gauge exposure  without compliance or specialized sampling or to determine prioritization of  sampling efforts. &nbsp;They may also be  appropriate during emergency response situations.&nbsp; </p>
