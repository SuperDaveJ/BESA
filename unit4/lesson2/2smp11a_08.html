<p class='popTitle'>Chemical Mixtures</p>
<p>The  exposure limits set by the standards are established for a pure form of the  chemicals.&nbsp; However, when more than one  chemical is used, there is a potential for health effects that are greater than  each chemical used alone would cause.&nbsp;  For example, spray paint has many ingredients, and you must assess the  exposure not only to each chemical individually, but also to the mixture of  chemicals.&nbsp; </p>
