<p class='popTitle'>Identifying the Degree of Health Threat</p>
<p>In order to identify the degree of health threat,  you must determine the concentrations of materials in the air that may cause  acute or chronic damage to a worker&rsquo;s health.&nbsp;  It is important to know as much as possible about the chemicals or  substances with which you are dealing, such as their vapor density and  toxicological properties.</p>
<p>Along with typical health threats, you must also  keep in mind that many chemicals can be explosive, or they can be asphyxiants (i.e., they displace oxygen).&nbsp; Other chemicals may pose health risks without  exhibiting warning properties.</p>
<p>Additionally,  it is important to remember that even if a standard does not exist, or if concentrations  in the air fall below acceptable standards, health effects may occur anyway.&nbsp; A situation in which health effects are occurring would require further  attention.</p>
