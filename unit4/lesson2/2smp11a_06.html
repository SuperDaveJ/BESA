<p class='popTitle'>Excursion Limit (OEL-EL)</p>
<p>The Excursion Limit is a  control limit established for chemicals without published STELs or Ceiling  Limits.&nbsp; These limits are based on  statistical rather than toxicological considerations.&nbsp; The worker&rsquo;s exposure may exceed three times  the OEL, but for no more than a total of 30 minutes, provided that the 8-hour  TWA does not exceed the OEL standard.&nbsp;  The worker&rsquo;s exposure must never exceed five times the OEL.</p>
<p>Excursion limits are not intended to be used as  OELs.&nbsp; Exposures in excess of these  limits indicate potential variations in exposure which should be further  evaluated to verify compliance with the OEL-TWA.&nbsp; Experienced judgment is needed to properly  apply these limits.</p>
