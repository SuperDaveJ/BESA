<p class='popTitle'>Skin Notation</p>
<p>Although not an OEL,  skin notation identifies chemicals that have a significant route of entry by  absorption through the skin, mucous membranes, and eyes.&nbsp; The &ldquo;skin&rdquo; designation after the chemical  name in the standard alerts you that overexposure may occur following dermal  contact even when airborne exposures are at or below the OEL.&nbsp; If large areas of the skin are exposed for a  long period, it is difficult to know how much contaminant is getting into the  body.&nbsp; The skin notation is intended to  suggest proper personal protective measures, such as gloves and aprons, to  prevent cutaneous absorption.&nbsp; Biological  monitoring should be used to evaluate exposure through skin absorption, where  possible.</p>
