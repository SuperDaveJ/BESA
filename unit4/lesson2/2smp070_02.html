<p class='popTitle'>True Exposure</p>
<p>One  sample cannot provide an accurate measurement of a worker&rsquo;s true exposure.&nbsp; Consider an example of a highway patrol  officer using a radar gun.&nbsp; One measurement  taken by this instrument may tell the officer that you&rsquo;re driving under the  speed limit, when, in actuality, you had been speeding a few moments before the  reading was taken.</p>
<p>Just as one reading by a radar gun cannot tell the  officer if you <em>ever</em> speed, one sample cannot tell you whether a worker  is ever exposed to harmful levels of a contaminant.&nbsp; Multiple samples are needed to gain an  understanding of the worker&rsquo;s true exposure.</p>
