<p class='popTitle'>Communicate</p>
<p>Communication is a key  component of the HRA process.&nbsp; You must  be proactive in communicating risks and recommendations to commanders about  controlling those risks.&nbsp; Initially, the  commander will typically ask you for a recommendation or input; however, after a  decision is made, commanders will likely assume that the recommendation remains  valid unless they are told otherwise.&nbsp; Therefore,  it is important for you to provide on-going recommendations, updates,  alternatives, and courses of action as needed based on routine and special  surveillance.</p>
<p>You must also communicate health risks to  personnel or community members whenever their health and safety are or may be  affected.</p>
