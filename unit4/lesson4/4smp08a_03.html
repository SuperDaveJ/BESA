<p class='popTitle'>Handling and Preservation</p>
<p>When immediate  analysis of the collected sample is not possible, take precautions so that the  sample characteristics are not altered.</p>
<p>Proper handling  of the samples includes following the storage requirements listed in the  analytical method description and the appropriate chain of custody  procedures.&nbsp; A good sampling habit is to  keep the number of people who handle the sample to a minimum.</p>
<p>Most water  samples are preserved by pH and temperature adjustments; however, you should  consult the specific storage and preservation directions listed in the  analytical method description.&nbsp; <br />
  These guidelines  will help ensure quality handling and preservation:&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
  <li>Before you begin sampling, plan how and  when you will transport the samples back to the laboratory so that all samples  are preserved and delivered to the laboratory as quickly as possible and within  recommended holding times.&nbsp; This is  especially important for samples like Nitrate/Nitrite that have holding times  of 24 hours or less.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>Coordinate with the receiving  laboratory to ensure that the samples will be held at the correct temperature  and analyzed within the appropriate timeframe. </li>
  <li>Store the samples in a manner which  ensures that the parameters to be analyzed are not altered, and use appropriate  preservation methods and holding times.</li>
  <li>Ensure that the container material does  not interfere with the analysis of the specific parameters. </li>
  <li>Check all sample bottles for integrity  (i.e., no cracks, dirty caps/bottles, etc.), and clean the exterior of the  bottles to avoid spreading contamination to other people and equipment involved  with the analysis process.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Because samples collected  from drums are usually of an unidentified nature, you should not add preservatives  due to the potential reaction of the sample with the preservative.&nbsp; Samples should, however, be cooled to 4&deg;C and protected from sunlight.</p>
