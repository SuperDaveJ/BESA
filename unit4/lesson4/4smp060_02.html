<p class='popTitle'>Homogeneity</p>
<p>Uniform distribution of  constituents, or homogeneity, is a desired effect of turbulence (e.g., that  produced by a hydraulic jump) and good mixing (e.g., from the spring and fall  turnovers of a lake).</p>
<p>Poor mixing (e.g.,  stratification in lakes or a slow-moving river downstream of a waste discharge)  results in different densities of the constituents, such as floating oils or  settling suspended solids.&nbsp; Chemical or  biological reactions, such as growth of algae in upper layers of the body of  water, cause changes in pH.</p>
<p>In order to ensure  homogeneity, you should sample from several locations to obtain the required  information.&nbsp; Suggested areas to collect  samples include:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Significant outlets       and inputs of lakes, impoundments, estuaries, or coastal areas that       exhibit eutrophic characteristics (i.e., nutrient-rich water with an       abundance of plant life and reduced oxygen content).</li>
  <li>Upstream and       downstream of major population and/or industrial centers which have       significant discharges into a flowing stream.</li>
  <li>Upstream and downstream of representative land  use areas.</li>
</ul>
