<p class='popTitle'>Address Follow-Up Needs</p>
<p>As  part of the OEHSA process, you should identify the need for follow-up sampling  and develop a plan for reassessment, including sampling frequency.</p>
<p>If you are sampling as part of an established  sampling strategy, frequency and follow-up needs should already be identified  and should only change if circumstances affecting the potable water system  change. &nbsp;Reassessment frequency is  determined by categorizing the risk associated with the area of concern (AOC)  as high, medium, or low and may need to be reevaluated after all risks have  been fully characterized.</p>
