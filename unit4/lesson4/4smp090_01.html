<p class='popTitle'>Document</p>
<p>Detailed  sample documentation is an integral part of the overall sampling strategy. Without documentation, vital information is  lost, which can result in time, resources, and money being spent rebuilding the  lost data or experience. You must record  parameters before and after taking groundwater samples.</p>
<p>Information  that must be recorded for all samples includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Date, time, and weather conditions.</li>
  <li>Collected by and method used.</li>
  <li>Specific sampling location and source.</li>
  <li>Sample volume and type (e.g., grab).</li>
  <li>Sample identification number.</li>
  <li>Direct reading instrument readings (as appropriate).</li>
  <li>Sampling rationale (i.e., Why  was the sample collected?&nbsp; Area screening  sample or follow-up to personnel over-exposure?)</li>
</ul>
