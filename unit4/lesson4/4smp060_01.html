<p class='popTitle'>Representativeness</p>
<p>It is important for the  sample to accurately characterize the condition of the water or liquid being  sampled.</p>
<p>When sampling an unknown  substance, collecting a representative sample can be influenced by the sampling  equipment you use.&nbsp; For example, when  using a Composite Liquid Waste Sampler (COLIWASA), you can sample specific  layers within a liquid.</p>
<p>In a deployed setting where  BE conducts non-potable water sampling, you can help ensure a representative sample  by choosing the most appropriate sampling locations, such as the following:&nbsp; </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Representative       sites in the main stream of rivers, estuaries, coastal areas, lakes, or       impoundments.</li>
  <li>Major water use       areas, such as public water supply intakes, commercial fishing areas, and       recreational areas.</li>
  <li>Representative       sites in the individual waste streams. </li>
  <li>Mouths of major or       significant tributaries to mainstreams, estuaries, or coastal areas.</li>
</ul>
<p>The  analyte of interest will affect your choice of sampling locations.&nbsp; For example, if you are interested in an oils  and grease sample, you would collect the sample from the top of the water.&nbsp; On the other hand, if you are interested in  knowing the concentration of heavy metals in an area, you may take a sample  from the bottom of a surface water source.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When choosing sampling locations, keep in mind  that contaminant migration can occur due to current or flow direction. </p>
