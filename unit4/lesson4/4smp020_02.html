<p class='popTitle'>High-Threat Environment</p>
<p>New  sampling strategies are required in higher threat situations such as deployed  environments or where potential areas of contamination require investigation  outside of routine surveillance.&nbsp; When  developing the sampling strategy for these kinds of situations, it is important  to consider source water as well as target areas in the water system as areas  that may require sampling.</p>
