<p class='popTitle'>Representative Samples</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve already learned that  samples must be taken in such a way that they characterize or approximate the  quality or condition of the water body or nonaqueous liquid.</p>
<p>The following are some guidelines  you can follow to obtain representative water samples: <strong></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Collect the sample where water or liquid is well  mixed. </li>
  <li>In a channel, collect the sample in the center at a  depth that avoids bottom bed loads and top floating materials, unless you are  sampling for those particular analytes.</li>
  <li>In a wide channel, divide the channel cross section  into different vertical sections so that each section is of equal width.&nbsp; Take a representative sample in each vertical  section.</li>
  <li>In a deep stream or lake, collect the samples at  different depths. </li>
  <li>When manual sampling with jars, place the mouth of  the collecting container below the liquid surface and facing flow to avoid an excess  of floating material.&nbsp; Keep your hand as  far as possible away from the mouth of the jar.</li>
  <li>If samples are taken from a closed conduit via a  valve or faucet arrangement, allow sufficient flushing time to ensure that the sample  is representative of the supply, taking into account the diameter, length of  the pipe to be flushed, and the velocity of the flow.</li>
</ul>
<p>When sampling containerized liquids, you can  ensure representative sampling by using equipment that collects a sample from  the full depth of the drum, such as the COLIWASA.</p>
