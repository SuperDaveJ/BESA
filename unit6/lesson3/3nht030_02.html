<p class='popTitle'>Product Substitution</p>
<p>When new equipment is  being considered or purchased, it must have the lowest noise levels that are  technologically and economically feasible.&nbsp;  Newer and quieter equipment, as reported by the manufacturer, does not  replace the need for you to perform your own readings on the equipment;  however, manufacturer information can assist you with making recommendations to  decision-makers about what to purchase.</p>
<p>When it is deemed necessary to replace good but  noisy equipment, there may also be advantages other than lower sound levels  that help outweigh the expense.&nbsp; The  newer equipment might be more productive, consume less energy, or provide  better quality control.</p>
