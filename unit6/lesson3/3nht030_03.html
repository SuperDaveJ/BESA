<p class='popTitle'>Machine Treatments</p>
<p>In addition to  regular and appropriate repair and maintenance, machine treatments should be  considered to reduce vibration of the equipment.&nbsp; This is an important option which is often  neglected until a noise problem becomes severe.&nbsp;  Malfunctioning or poorly maintained equipment sometimes makes more noise  than properly maintained equipment.&nbsp;  There are three methods for treating machines to reduce the noise being  produced.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reduce the  driving force of the machine by adjusting the rotational forces, replacing worn  parts, balancing, alignment, or lubrication.</li>
  <li>Isolate the  responding surface when modification to the driving force is not  practical.&nbsp; Use strategies such as  installing metal machine guards, grilles, and equipment casings to increase the  isolation of the machine.</li>
  <li>Reduce surface response by increasing the mass  of the surface to cut down on vibration.&nbsp;  Materials with greater thickness or density vibrate much less.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
