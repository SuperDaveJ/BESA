<p class='popTitle'>Indirect Noise Pathway</p>
<p>Indirect noise is transmitted when vibrations from  the source travel through a solid and are then transmitted through the air to  the receiver.&nbsp; This type of noise is  usually generated at lower frequencies.&nbsp;  An example of indirect noise is the &ldquo;hum&rdquo; transmitted through ducts,  steel girders, and floors from items such as a loud stereo system or large  moving machinery.</p>
<p>The primary control used for indirect path  noises is vibration isolation by relocating the source or using anti-vibration  materials, such as springs, rubber, or foam.</p>
