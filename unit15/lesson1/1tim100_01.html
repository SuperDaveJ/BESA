<p class='popTitle'>Conduct an Inventory</p>
<p>As you begin creating an  inventory of TIC/TIM threats on and around Hoyt AFB, you include the toxic  chemicals regulated under the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk  Management Program (RMP)<strong> </strong>and those  listed in Tier II reports.&nbsp; You check  with Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPCs) and State Emergency Response  Commissions (SERCs) for data about TICs/TIMs located off base.&nbsp; You also conduct visual observation of  facilities within the vicinity of the base, and include information regarding HazMat  routes near the base, such as railways, waterways, and highways.</p>
<p>Once the off-base TIC/TIM  information is collected, you and the rest of the assessment team conduct an  inventory of TICs/TIMs stored on the base<strong> </strong>or piped into populated base facilities. &nbsp;Some sources you can check for information  about TICs/TIMs located on base include the:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Base Civil       Engineering bulk storage inventory.</li>
  <li>Base HazMat inventory.</li>
  <li>Base Radiation       Safety Officer (RSO).</li>
  <li>AF Radio-Isotope Committee.</li>
</ul>
