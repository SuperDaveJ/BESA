<p class='popTitle'>Example of Catastrophic Effects from TICs/TIMs</p>
<p>One  of the worst industrial accidents in history occurred in 1984, when 40 tons of  methyl isocyanate gas escaped from a pesticide plant in Bhopal, India,  and killed at least 3,000 people within a few days.&nbsp; Because of long-term health effects caused by  the leakage and failure to clean up the toxic remains, many more people have  died over the years.&nbsp; Thousands have also  become ill from breathing the toxic air, drinking tainted water, or handling  contaminated soil.&nbsp; The total number of  deaths and injuries is unknown.</p>
