<p class='popTitle'>Alternate Scenario</p>
<p>An alternate scenario is  intended to be representative of a situation that is more likely than a  worst-case scenario.&nbsp; Because it is  difficult to know the exact amount of chemicals in a certain location at a  given time, there are some general guidelines you can use when developing these  alternate scenarios.&nbsp; The amount of  chemicals released during an alternate scenario may be assumed to be equivalent  to the volume of one of the following:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>The largest single container if there are multiple containers stored at one location.</li>
  <li>Two-thirds of the maximum amount if only a single container exists. </li>
  <li>Two-thirds of the capacity of a vessel.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>If you had additional site-specific  information, you could evaluate a release of different amounts of  chemicals.&nbsp; For example, structural or  automated controls may be in place to limit the amount of the chemical that can  be released.</p>
<p>Railway data will typically  reveal how many railcars per year carry a specific chemical, but not how many  railcars per train.&nbsp; Because the quantity  being transported may vary, an estimate of 90 tons per railcar may be used if  no data is available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because you should consider the most probable  circumstances under which an exposure or release could occur, for alternate  scenarios, you assume that the wind blows in the prevalent direction. </p>
