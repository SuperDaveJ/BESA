<p class='popTitle'>Probabilities</p>
<p>A scenario is given a  probability rating of frequent and/or likely if it is likely to occur <em>immediately or within a short period of time</em>.&nbsp; To make this determination, you should  consider whether the scenario has a demonstrated history of occurrence at the  specific site.&nbsp; For example, if a  particular type of release or exposure happens on average more than once every  two years, the scenario would receive the frequent/likely rating.</p>
<p>A scenario is given a  probability rating of occasional if it will <em>probably</em> occur in time.&nbsp; To  make this determination, you should consider whether the scenario has an  isolated history of occurrence at the specific site.</p>
<p>A scenario is given a  probability rating of seldom if it is <em>possible</em> to occur in time.&nbsp; To make this  determination, you should consider whether there is documented evidence of poor  handling or unsafe practices, or whether the scenario has some history of  occurrence within the industry.</p>
<p>For situations that are not expected to occur  based on historical data, a scenario is given a probability rating of unlikely.</p>
