<p class='popTitle'>Hazard Zones</p>
<p>A hazard zone is a zone  originating from a release or exposure that can potentially cause injury or  death. &nbsp;For chemical releases and  radioactive exposures in an unobstructed environment, the zones are depicted as  three concentric circles.&nbsp; When  evaluating the worst-case scenario, the TIC/TIM would be considered a hazard if  any part of the base falls within a hazard zone.&nbsp; For alternate case scenarios, the TIC/TIM is  only a hazard if the base is located downwind (based on prevailing winds) of  the TIC/TIM location.&nbsp; In other words, the  prevailing winds will blow the TIC/TIM toward the base.)&nbsp; For radioactive exposures where building  walls and other shielding exist, the zones take on irregular shapes.&nbsp; Hazard zones are delineated using hand  calculations or modeling software, using the downwind distances as the radii of  the three hazard zones.</p>
<p>Zone 1, which is equivalent  to LOC<sub>3</sub>, is an area where death may result from the release or exposure.&nbsp; For a chemical release, if a portion of the  base will be in Zone 1, then the scenario is rated as &ldquo;Catastrophic&rdquo;. &nbsp;A radioactive exposure would also receive this  rating if the closest regularly-occupied location is in Zone 1.&nbsp; This means the release or exposure may cause  death, loss of facility or assets, or grave damage to national interests.</p>
<p>Zone 2, which is equivalent  to LOC<sub>2</sub>, is an area where severe injuries and/or illnesses may  result.&nbsp; For a chemical release, if a  portion of the base will be in Zone 2, then the scenario is rated as  &ldquo;Critical&rdquo;.&nbsp; A radioactive exposure would  also receive this rating if the closest regularly-occupied location is in Zone  2.&nbsp; This means the release or exposure  may cause major injury, illness, property damage, damage to national service or  command interests, or degradation to efficient use of assets.</p>
<p>Zone 3, which is equivalent  to LOC<sub>1</sub>, is an area where minor injuries and/or illnesses may  result.&nbsp; For a chemical release, if a  portion of the base will be in Zone 3, then the scenario is rated as &ldquo;Moderate&rdquo;.&nbsp; A radioactive exposure would also receive  this rating if the closest regularly-occupied location is in Zone 3.&nbsp; This means the release or exposure may cause  minor injury, illness, property damage, damage to national service or command  interest or degradation to efficient use of assets.</p>
<p>If the base is located beyond Zone 3 for a  chemical release, or if the closest regularly-occupied location is beyond Zone  3 for a radioactive exposure, then the scenario is rated as &ldquo;Negligible.&rdquo;&nbsp; This means the release or exposure represents  a minimal threat to safety or health, property, national service or command  interests, or efficient use of assets. </p>
