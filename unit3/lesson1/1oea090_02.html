<p class='popTitle'>Air and Soil</p>
<p>Screening air and soil is critical to assist with beddown decisions in the expeditionary setting.  It is also the focus at established bases in completing the OEHSA and determining OEH risks in the workplace.</p>

<p>The primary concern for this type of screening is to ensure that all health threats generated from industrial-type operations, or due to geographic location, are immediately assessed to determine potential and actual pathways and exposures.  Health threats include physical hazards such as noise, radiation, and thermal stress as well.</p>
