<p class='popTitle'>Surface Water</p>
<p>Initial surface water screening starts with sampling of waters located within the perimeter of the site or base. Sampling then proceeds to other areas such as surface waters, streams, and ditches that personnel or equipment may come into contact with during operations.</p>

<p>Surface water screening should be conducted as environmental and weather conditions change or as the size of the AO changes. This sampling is important because surface water may be used as a drinking water source.</p>
