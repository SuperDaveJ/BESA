<p class='popTitle'>Department of State (DOS)</p>
<p>The Department of State (DOS) is responsible for US diplomats abroad. Additionally, the DOS provides advisories to US travelers abroad. This may be useful information for OCONUS locations in particular, regarding contact information for embassies and consulates. </p>

<p>Embassies  and consulates can provide useful local information such as medical  capabilities, host nation sources, state and local agencies, foreign  intelligence threats, and local threats. Since each embassy has a military attaché, it is important to establish contact and derive current intelligence from this source. Additionally, the embassy may be the conduit by which units expedite requests to the host nation. This contact may be facilitated through an intelligence officer.</p>
