<p class='popTitle'>Drinking Water</p>
<p>You  should assess all water sources prior to use to determine whether they would be  good sources of water for the base. The data collected during the initial surveillance will be used to establish the long-term monitoring plan to maintain force health protection. In addition to the traditional sampling methods, field analysis of the source water can be conducted to determine whether the source is treatable.</p>

<p>Drinking water quality is evaluated on both source water and product water (i.e., after treatment). Bottled water plants should be sampled and inspected if the plant is not currently approved for use by the US Army Veterinary Command.</p>

<p>Quality standards for potable water vary depending on force structure and duration of use. You should identify, document, and evaluate all drinking water sources prior to use and at regular intervals throughout the operation. This is done to ensure that the hazard profiles have not changed.</p>
