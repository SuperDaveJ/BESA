<p class='popTitle'>Intelligence Sources</p>
<p>Health information can be found in various intelligence products. Intelligence can assist in identifying unique threats to a deployed area. In addition, intelligence updates should be requested on a periodic basis to determine whether the threats have decreased, increased, or remained the same. If specific intelligence is not available, the BE should consult the base or local intelligence officer and submit a "Request for Information.” Be sure to allow sufficient time for this system to work (e.g., 2-3 weeks). Do not limit the request to a specific agency since this may reduce opportunities for broader information to meet operational health requirements. Also, request the proper classification level for your intelligence needs.</p>
