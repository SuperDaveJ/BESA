<p class='popTitle'>Habitat for Pests and Rodents / Vector Breeding Areas</p>
<p>Pests and rodents can cause a variety of health risks to personnel.  Selecting a site that minimizes these risks is important.</p>
<p>You should determine if there are any potential vector-breeding areas nearby such as swamps, ponds, marshy areas, or standing water.</p>
<p>Tall grass and thick underbrush are often the breeding ground for ticks and fleas and should be avoided.  Dumps and landfills which attract flies and rodents should also be avoided.</p>
<p>If you discover any of these potential health risks,  you should inform Public Health.</p>
