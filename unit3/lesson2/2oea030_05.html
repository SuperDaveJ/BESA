<p class='popTitle'>Water Sources</p>
<p>Water sources are a key factor in the selection of a site.  In addition to the need for potable water, you should consider whether the type / location of water present can cause a situation for bacterial or viral infections to spread.</p>

<p>The availability of surface water vs. groundwater is also an important consideration for site selection.  You should determine if source water is or can be made potable.</p>

<p>When selecting a site, base your recommendations regarding water on the sources' quantity, quality, accessibility, and vulnerability.</p>
