<p class='popTitle'>Soil Composition</p>
<p>Soil composition is an important factor overall because the soil impacts many operations on the site.  Composition of the soil can affect the digging of pit latrines and garbage trenches and the use of soakage pits, in addition to how well the soil holds tent stakes and absorbs liquid wastes.</p> 
<p>The primary concern with soil composition from a BE perspective is how the composition affects exposure pathways for health threats.  You should examine soil for existing contamination and the ability to transport chemicals or release vapors because of its composition and the activities that will be conducted on the site.</p>
