For each hazardous material, the OELs are the most stringent limits found in the latest edition of the TLV Booklet published annually by the American Conference of Government Industrial Hygienists, in 29 CFR 1910 Subpart Z, and in AFOSH Standards for specific substances.  OELs apply to occupational exposures for each individual worker for a single 8-hour work shift except where 29 CFR 1910 Subpart Z allows 40-hour averages.  Exposure during work shifts that exceed 8 hours must be adjusted before applying an OEL.</p>

	<p>Energy in the form of waves or moving subatomic particles emitted by an atom or other body as it changes from a higher energy state to a lower energy state.</p>
<span class="term">Radiation Absorbed Dose (RAD)</span>
	<p>The amount of radiation absorbed by the tissue. </p>
<span class="term">Radioactive Decay</span>
	<p>The spontaneous disintegration or transformation of an atom in an attempt by that atom to reach a stable state. </p>
<span class="term">Radioactive Material (RAM)</span>
	<p>Material which contains unstable (radioactive) atoms that give off radiation as they decay or transform.</p>
<span class="term">Radioactivity</span>
	<p>The spontaneous emission of matter or energy from the nucleus of an unstable atom.</p>
<span class="term">Radioisotopes </span>
	<p>Unstable isotopes that, in an attempt to become a stable atom, emit energy in the form of radiation.</p>
<span class="term">Regulated Area</span>
    <p>An area under the supervisor&rsquo;s control where entry and exit are restricted and controlled to prevent exposure to hazards. An area shall be established when a requirement in 29 CFR 1910 or 29 CFR 1926 exists, or when BE determines that employees entering the area might be exposed to a hazard unless access is controlled.</p>

<span class="term">Short Term Exposure Limit (OEL- STEL)</span>
    <p>A time-weighted exposure for a 15 minute (or shorter) period which shall not be exceeded during the work day. The definition of STEL is different in 29 CFR 1910.1000 (a) (5) (ii) and in the TLV Booklet. The definition must correspond to the reference being cited. As with other OELs, OEL-STELs are the most stringent limits found in the latest TLV Booklet, in 29 CFR 1910 Subpart Z, and in AFOSH Standards for specific substances.</p>
<span class="term">Short-Term Public Emergency Exposure Guideline (SPEGL)</span>
    <p>An acceptable peak concentration for unpredicted, single, short-term emergency exposures of the general public. These limits do not apply to occupational exposures.</p>

    <p>Exposure guidelines published annually by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) in Threshold Limit Values for Chemical Substances and Physical Agents and Biological Exposure Indices. TLVRs are employed as OELs when they are more stringent than the OSHA PELs.</p>
<span class="term">Time-Weighted Average (OEL-TWA)</span>
    <p>Eight-hour average concentration for which the average is mathematically adjusted for the duration of exposure. The method for calculating OEL-TWAs is shown in 29 CFR 1910.1000 (d) and in the TLV Booklet.</p>
