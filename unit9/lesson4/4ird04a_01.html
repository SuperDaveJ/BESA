<p class='popTitle'>Time</p>
<p>Time, an administrative control, is the first method that  should be used to control exposures because of the proportional relationship  radiation doses have with the time spent in a radiation field.&nbsp; By limiting the exposure time to radiation,  you reduce the dose of radiation received by personnel.&nbsp; </p>
<p>You  can calculate the dose received based on the duration of exposure by using the  following formula:</p>
