<p class='popTitle'>Contamination Control</p>
<p>Contamination  control becomes an important administrative practice for controlling exposures  to radioactive materials and spills.&nbsp; A  spread of contamination can easily occur when personnel involved in a spill or  spill clean up move to various locations.&nbsp;  You can prevent the spread of contamination by restricting the movement  of personnel and conducting monitoring to verify that they are free of any  contamination before relocation is allowed.</p>
<p>If a minor spill occurs, it can be handled  safely by the lab staff without safety or emergency personnel.&nbsp; All other types of spills are considered  emergency situations.&nbsp; In any case,  personnel should notify the RSO to ensure awareness of the spill and proper  procedures are followed to clean it up. </p>
