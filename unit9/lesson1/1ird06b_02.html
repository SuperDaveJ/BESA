<p class='popTitle'>Stochastic Effects</p>
<p>Stochastic effects are those effects that occur by chance among unexposed  as well as exposed individuals. &nbsp;This  means there is no direct relationship between the cause and the effects of the  exposure.&nbsp; The only relationship between  the dose and the effects is that the probability of the effect increases with  an increase in dose.&nbsp; If an effect  occurs, the severity of that effect is not impacted by the dose received.</p>
<p>The stochastic effect has a zero-threshold implication.&nbsp; This means there is no &ldquo;safe&rdquo; level of  exposure and that even the smallest dose carries some health risk.&nbsp; The zero-threshold implication is the reason  the As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) concept is used to protect Air  Force radiation workers.</p>
<p>An example of a  stochastic effect is being diagnosed with cancer.&nbsp; Cancers have a baseline occurrence,  regardless of exposure status.&nbsp; Adding  radiation exposure increases the probability that a specified individual would  have cancer.&nbsp; However, that probability  is extremely low.&nbsp; Conversely, someone  who has never been exposed to ionizing radiation may have the exact same form  of cancer.&nbsp;</p>
