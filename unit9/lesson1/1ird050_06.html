<p class='popTitle'>Counts per minute (cpm)</p>
<p>The amount of radiation detected by an instrument  each minute is expressed in counts per minute (cpm).&nbsp; Instruments that read in cpm are usually used  to detect contamination.&nbsp; On a typical  installation, alpha and beta particles and low level x-rays are measured in the  unit of cpm.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Counts per minute are not  equal to disintegrations per minute because the measurement probes are not 100%  efficient.&nbsp; Disintegrations per minute  can be estimated by dividing the counts per minute by the efficiency of the  probe.</p>
<p>Scintillation  probes are commonly used to detect activity.&nbsp;  The amount of activity detected by the probe depends on the efficiency  of the tube inside the detection equipment.&nbsp;  Larger tubes will have better efficiency to detect the amount of  activity. </p>
