<p class='popTitle'>Deterministic Effects</p>
<p>The severity of deterministic effects is directly related to the dose  received.</p>
<p>Deterministic effects appear based on several assumptions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A certain  minimum dose must be exceeded before the particular effect is observed. </li>
  <li>The magnitude  of the effect increases with the size of the dose. </li>
  <li>There is a  direct causal relationship between exposure to the radiation and the observed  effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>An example of a deterministic effect is cataract formation.&nbsp; The severity of the cataract, which includes  the speed of onset, is directly related to the magnitude of the dose received  by the corneal lens.</p>
<p>This effect can be seen  in other non-radiation related situations also.&nbsp;  For example, a person must exercise a certain amount of time before the  effects are observed through responses such as increased heart rate and  perspiration.&nbsp; As the person continues to  exercise, these effects are increased due to the continuing work being  performed.</p>
