<p class='popTitle'>Occupancy Factor</p>
<p>The occupancy factor takes into consideration how  much time a person may be located in an area adjacent to operating radiation equipment.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>For example, the amount of time spent in an  occupied office is normally much greater than in a stairway.&nbsp; Therefore, the occupancy factor allows this  difference to be accounted for when calculating the annual exposure for that  area. </p>
  <p>Once an annual exposure is calculated, if an  occupancy factor should be considered, you should reduce the exposure of the  calculated amount by the percentage indicated for that occupancy factor. </p>
