<p>Instruct the technician to expose the container of  water.&nbsp; Note the meter readings.</p>
<p>When you collect data for medical x-rays, you must  take two sets of measurements.&nbsp; One set  should be taken with the x-ray unit pointing toward the chest cassette and one  set should be taken pointing toward the x-ray table.</p>
<p>As the technician exposes the water, you should  make sure the peak exposure rates from the x-ray unit do not exceed the rating of  your measurement instrument. </p>
<p>When you collect data for  dental x-rays, you must also take two sets of measurements.&nbsp; One set should be taken for each direction  the x-ray tube is pointing.</p>
<p>In  addition, if an x-ray unit has a panoramic head, you must take measurements  while it is operational.</p>
