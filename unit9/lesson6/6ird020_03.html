<p class='popTitle'>Transfer to Another User</p>
<p>There may be other areas of the  Air Force which can benefit from certain types of radioactive materials when no  longer in use.&nbsp; If this option is  available, you should make arrangements to transfer the RAM to the possession  of another user within the Air Force.&nbsp; For  example, radioactive check sources that are no longer needed at one base can be  sent to another base.</p>
<p>Most transfers should be coordinated through the AFRRAD  office because they have information about who needs the RAM or who is willing  to accept it.</p>
