<p class='popTitle'>Communicating with Commanders</p>
<p>Make  sure your analysis is clearly understood by the commander and can be  defended at a later date, especially if a long-term health risk was accepted to  accomplish the mission at that time.&nbsp;  Noncompliance with various requirements, when a health risk is minimal,  is an option depending on the operational context; however, commanders must understand  the implications and select COAs accordingly.</p>
