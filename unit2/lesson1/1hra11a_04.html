<p class='popTitle'>Is there the potential for exposure variability?</p>
<p>You  should determine if the exposure has the potential to vary based on factors  such as changing environmental conditions, movement of personnel into other  locations, or working between several shops while performing similar  functions.&nbsp; These situations may require  additional analysis to ensure the changes do not affect the potential risk to  personnel.&nbsp; Exposure changes may also  impact the choice of controls used to manage the health risk. </p>
