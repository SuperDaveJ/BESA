<p class='popTitle'>Ultraviolet Radiation from the Sun</p>
<p>The amount of UV radiation  from the sun varies through the year and throughout the day.&nbsp; The amount of UV radiation is greatest when  the sun is directly overhead.&nbsp; At this  time, the UV radiation travels through less atmosphere and is therefore stronger,  potentially causing more damage.</p>
<p>When  the sun is lower in the sky, more UV radiation is absorbed and scattered in the  atmosphere, making the amount of UV exposure less detrimental.</p>
<p>BE plays an important role when protecting  personnel who work outside from a UV overexposure due to excessive time spent  in the sun.</p>
